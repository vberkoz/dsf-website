**_"Sales people need to learn to listen"_**  - Stephen Zarick
\
A few things are going to occur during this approach call.
- You have to engage in a conversation
- You have to explain quickly what you are offering
- And then you are going to expect this stranger to tell you or to share with you that they have a "problem"

\
Really?
\
Some still open the call with joking their way through a hello.
Some open the call with "How was your weekend?".
Some might open the call with the weather, or a sporting event.
\
Stop!
\
Who has time for this? And why would a stranger want to tell you how their weekend was? I don't even like telling people, that work with me, how my weekend was. I'm busy and they really don't care any way.
\
If the goal of your sales call is to get a stranger to share pain with you, why annoy them on the outset?
\
Learn to be real. Learn to **demonstrate empathy** for the right reasons.
\
How is business? How is business in this soft economy? Are you hiring or not? Are you pulled into budget meetings every week? Is the Internet affecting your business and changing processes? Not - "How are the Bengals doing?"
\
If you are going to get a stranger of a publicly traded company to share pain with you on a 1st or 2nd call, you must be “real”. **You must build trust.**
\
You need to learn to demonstrate empathy. You must avoid WE statements. WE do this, WE do that. You must embrace: **it's not about US, it's about them.** Or you will get nothing out of your phone call. You must build trust. You must listen and hear them out. Every buyer has the right to be cynical.
\
The old icebreakers don't work anymore especially in phone sales or even email selling.
\
Don't waste your prospect's time. Do not act like they are your friend - they are a stranger. If you have something of value to offer, then make sure they need it 1st before you start offering.
\
Ask questions
- Learn to demonstrate empathy by asking pertinent questions to establish your credibility to get a stranger to share their pain
- Expect to hear "No"
- Expect to listen and "demonstrate empathy" ask them to tell you more
- Every prospect will be cynical because they have been beat up by sales people, it is now habitual to say "No".
- How will you diffuse this and get to, not a "Yes", but to a “That's Right”? To Trust?
- Demonstrate empathy, this will work in all facets of your life not just sales.
